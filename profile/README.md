# Decentralized Game Standard

**Protocols for Games That Endure as Open Rulesets, Not Fragile Products — Conceptual Framework, 2026-01-14**

Physical games have endured for centuries because they are fundamentally open rulesets played with neutral artifacts. Anyone can grab a ball and play soccer in a park—no permission needed from FIFA. Variants emerge freely: pickup games, backyard rules, niche leagues. Professional spectacles (World Cup, Premier League) add polish and scale as voluntary overlays, but they never own the game itself. Equipment makers, coaches, and local organizers build thriving ecosystems around the open core without gatekeeping play.

Digital games have taken the opposite path: built as proprietary products controlled by publishers who own the "ball," the rules, the field, and the scoreboard. This creates extraordinary short-term experiences but systemic fragility—games shut down, assets vanish, communities fracture, and innovation bottlenecks through gatekeepers.

The Decentralized Game Standard realigns digital play with its physical roots. It treats genres as eternal, open rulesets rather than disposable products. Persistent artifacts (items, characters) exist independently on Nostr. Composable engines interpret rules flexibly. Coordination flows peer-to-peer with instant settlement. The result: casual "pickup" games happen spontaneously, niche variants thrive without needing mass scale, and ambitious "pro league" experiences can emerge as voluntary services on top—competed against, forked, or ignored if they overreach.

This is not utopian purity demanding everything be fully decentralized. It is pragmatic freedom: a neutral, permissionless foundation that enables abundant play, with optional centralized layers for convenience and spectacle.

## The Product Paradigm and Its Failings

Digital games became products because abundance was channeled into artificial scarcity. Publishers control servers, asset validity, matchmaking, and monetization—making every experience contingent on their continued interest.

Real-world evidence shows the cost:

- **Preservation Crisis** — Live-service titles vanish routinely (The Crew delisted in 2024, Knockout City ended 2023, hundreds of others). Player progress and purchases evaporate.
- **Locked Assets** — Items rarely travel between games without corporate deals. Engine lock-in traps entire projects.
- **Modding and Community Fragility** — Mods sustain classics like Skyrim, yet monetization efforts repeatedly fail under centralized curation and high rents.
- **Gatekept Coordination** — Esports scenes die unilaterally. Server hosting relies on unreliable donations. Discovery algorithms bury most creations while extracting 30%+.

These stem from forced centralization at the foundation. The alternative is not anarchy—it's an open base layer with voluntary centralization where useful.

## Core Premise: Genres as Sports, Not Products

A battle royale should feel like soccer: core concepts (shrinking zone, looting, last-player-standing) are neutral and persistent. Anyone can host a quick match with friends or strangers. Items earned in one session carry forward. Niche variants (zombie mode, prop hunt) emerge without approval. Massive, polished tournaments with ranked ladders and streaming can exist as opt-in services—funded directly, competed against freely.

The standard achieves this by separating durable artifacts from interpretive rules and enabling frictionless coordination:

| Protocol | Core Mechanism | Primary Failures Addressed |
|----------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **AEMS** (Asset-Entity-Manifestation-State) | Nostr events defining universal Entities, game-specific Manifestations, mutable State, and optional ownership | Preservation, asset lock-in, interoperability |
| **GERS** (Game Engine Record Standard) | Data-flow engine architecture with uniform Records and stateless Processors | Engine rigidity, mod fragility, long-term maintenance |
| **WOSS** (Work-Offer Settlement Standard) | Three-event coordination language settled via Lightning | Gatekept value flow, centralized coordination, discovery rents |

Built on mature primitives—Nostr for resilient data, Lightning for instant micropayments—no blockchains, tokens, or new consensus layers.

## How It Works in Practice

Imagine "MOBA" as a genre like basketball:

- A community defines universal Entities (heroes, items, creeps) via AEMS.
- Different groups publish Manifestations: "classic Dota-style," "fast-paced beginner variant," "underwater twist."
- Players own instances with history and state that persist on Nostr.

Casual play: Someone posts a WOSS offer—"500 sats buy-in for a quick MOBA lobby tonight, classic rules." Others join via any GERS-compatible client. A community-hosted server (or P2P mesh) runs the match. Items import automatically. No accounts, no platform—just play.

Niche play: A small group runs their weird variant weekly. It stays cult forever, like church-league softball.

Pro-layer play: A popular organizer bounties high-uptime servers, anti-cheat Processors, and ranked matchmaking via recurring WOSS offers. Thousands opt in for polished experience and streamed tournaments. Third-party clients emerge with slick UI, discovery feeds, or premium overlays. If the organizer gets extractive, players fork the ruleset or drop to raw pickup lobbies—the foundation guarantees exit.

Value flows horizontally: modders earn directly for new Manifestations, artists for assets, hosts for reliability, streamers for casting. Ecosystems grow around the open ruleset (client apps, analytics tools, "equipment" like custom renderers) without anyone owning the game itself.

Single-player adventures (Zelda-likes) fit too: worlds as shared Entity collections, mods as new Manifestations/Processors, persistence beyond any one engine.

## Scope: Systemic Depth and Authored Vision

This standard optimizes for games that benefit from longevity and community evolution—like sports or folklore genres. Yet it equally serves bounded, singular experiences (narrative adventures, puzzle stories, artistic experiments) by providing a neutral, durable substrate that creators can use privately. Mechanics can be refined on open foundations; stories, surprises, and IP remain fully under author control. The paradigm rejects artificial scarcity not to force sharing, but to ensure no game—open or closed—vanishes due to corporate whim or technical obsolescence.

## The Protocols

### AEMS: Durable Entities
Layered Nostr events make artifacts independent and interpretable.
- Universal Entity (e.g., "sword that deals damage").
- Game-specific Manifestation (e.g., +50 attack, fire enchantment).
- Mutable State (durability, upgrades).
- Optional signed ownership chain.

Items earned in one game persist for import elsewhere.

### GERS: Composable Engines
Data-oriented design: everything is Records with Fields, transformed by stateless Processors wired into Networks.
- Swap renderers, physics, or input without rewriting core.
- Mods are native Processor additions.
- Naturally supports parallelism and explicit data flow.

Engines import AEMS Entities as Records and apply selected Manifestations.

### WOSS: Permissionless Coordination
Three Nostr events (Offer, Fulfill, Ack) settled via Lightning.
- Fund servers, bounty assets, pay modders, pool tournament prizes.
- Direct, instant, no rake.

Communities coordinate at any scale without gatekeepers.

## Technical Foundation

- **Nostr** — Signed, relay-replicated events for all persistent data.
- **Lightning** — Near-zero-fee settlement for commitments.
- Minimal by design: no speculative assets, no consensus overhead.

## Example Emergence

A player discovers a rare shield:
- Defined universally via AEMS Entity.
- Manifested differently across games.
- State tracks battle history.
- A modder (funded via WOSS) adds visual flair Processor.
- Ownership transfers permissionlessly.
- One hosted game ends—the shield lives on for the next pickup match or pro tournament.

## Status and Scope

These are conceptual specifications—minimal, open, and language-agnostic—inviting experimentation. No reference implementations yet exist. The focus is the hardest problems: preservation, permissionless play, and open ecosystems. Massive synchronous experiences may always involve voluntary centralized layers; the standard guarantees they remain optional.

This is an invitation to build games that compound cultural value across decades, like chess or soccer, rather than resetting with corporate cycles.

Experiment. Host a pickup game. Define an Entity. Watch ecosystems emerge.
