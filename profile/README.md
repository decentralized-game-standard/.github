# Decentralized Game Standard

What if video games could last a thousand years, like Senet or chess? Not as relics, but as living protocols—open, adaptable, free of corporate cages. The **Decentralized Game Standard** isn’t a product or a rigid fix. It’s a call to rethink digital gaming from the ground up, using decentralized ideas to make games timeless, fair, and truly ours.

## Philosophy: Games Should Endure

A chess piece works anywhere—any board, any variant—because it’s not owned by a company. Poker chips, built for one game, carry value across countless others since they exist beyond a server’s lifespan. Pokémon cards in your closet don’t vanish when the company folds; you can still battle your grandson 80 years from now. These games thrive because they’re protocols—simple, universal, unbound.

Digital games? They’re fragile. When servers die, so do worlds. Stories fade, assets lock up, players lose what they’ve earned. It’s not that AAA giants or centralized platforms are evil—they’re the logical fruit of yesterday’s tech, delivering marvels like never before. But now, we can do better. We can craft games that don’t expire, that live outside walled gardens, that cost less to dream up and stand the test of time.

## The Real Problem

The disconnect is stark: physical games outlast empires; digital ones barely survive a decade. Why?
- **Walled Gardens**: A sword in one game can’t join another—not because it shouldn’t, but because it’s trapped by design.
- **Server Dependency**: Shut the server, kill the game. No Pokémon Company, no problem—physical cards still play. Digital? Lights out.
- **Reinventing Basics**: Every studio rebuilds the wheel—entities, rewards, engines—wasting effort on what could be shared.

This isn’t about forcing a potion across titles. It’s about possibility: a chess piece *can* roam, so why can’t a digital one? The problem’s obvious when you see it—games shouldn’t die with their makers.

## The Fix: A Decentralized Rethink

We’re imagining a future that doesn’t exist yet: games as open protocols, built to last. Picture a sword defined simply—say, `{ "name": "Iron Blade", "type": "weapon" }`—stored on **Nostr**, a lightweight, open, decentralized messaging network. Any game can grab it, tweak it—50 damage here, a stun there—while players own it via **Liquid**, tied to Bitcoin’s staying power, not a token scam.

Rewards? A level designer earns sats—pennies via **Lightning**—for a map that slots into any game, no platform skimming. Tools? Snap together entire custom game engines with interoperable processors—like a renderer or physics bit—into a lean engine, guided by a flow model, not a bloated default.

This isn’t crypto grift—it’s the opposite. It’s ditching hype for real decentralization, shining a light on what’s possible when games aren’t tethered to servers, gatekeepers or D.I.N.O. centralized tokens.

## The Tech: Simple, Lasting Freedom

No buzzwords, just tools that work:
- **Nostr**: Shares data—like entity schemas or job signals—without blockchain bloat.
- **Liquid**: Secures ownership with Bitcoin’s backbone, not fleeting tokens.
- **Lightning**: Moves value fast and cheap—sats for a task, done.

It doesn't sound hype because there's no hype. All utility, no ponzi-scheme. These aren’t trends—they’re picks for a future that stands up. Fake-decentralized gimmicks crumble; we’re betting on what’s real.

## What This Unlocks

Games that last 1,000 years—stories cheaper to tell, worlds that don’t vanish. This doesn’t kill AAA or favor indie. It’s a standard that lets big budgets shine and small dreams soar, free of unscrupulous one-sided chokeholds. A kid trades a 2025 digital card in 3025. A solo-dev crafts their soul into a game and can stand toe to toe with the giants. That’s the point.

## Future Glimmers

This is conceptual—seeds, grounded in a legitimate software stack. Tomorrow? Peer-to-peer servers, player IDs that stick, stories anyone can remix. It’s up to us to deem it important and make it real.

## Shape It

This needs you:
- **Ask**: What holds? What’s missing?
- **Try**: Sketch a schema, a reward, a tool—toss it here.
- **Talk**: Open an issue, spread the word.
